# Your solution to E28

Performance analysis, comparing all four designs you have implemented
instead of Design 1 with Design 5 as the book says.

To do this evaluation (of E26, E28-E30), for each design create random instances and
then call each method many thousands of times, and then find the elapsed time in milliseconds
for the fixed number of iterations. Make sure that your program runs each time for about
10 seconds, so you get a good measure of performance. Test each method separately.
Run each version several times to ensure that your results are consistent and use
the median result as your definitive result, plus give the maximum and minimum.

| Design | How cartesian coordinates are computed | How polar coordinates are computed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | Computed on demand, but not stored| Simply returned |
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | Simply returned | Computed on demand, but not stored |
| Design 4: Store both types of coordinates, using four instance variables| Simply returned | Simply returned |
| Design 5: Abstract class with designs 2 and 3 as subclasses Depends on the concrete class used | Depends on the concrete class used |

performance test code are in the folders of each design.

From the data above, we can find that methods getX, getY, getDistance and rotatePoint 
always need more time in design2; methods getTheta and convertStorageToPolar 
always need more time in design3; and method convertStorageToCartesian
always need more time in design4. Thus, design2 is probably less efficient than others. 
Since running time of most methods in design2 needs more time.
What's more, the running time of each method in design5 is always between the running 
time of each method in design2 and design3. Thus, design5 is more efficient. The average 
running time of each method in design5 is not very high.
